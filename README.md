---------------------------------------
This repository contains a Feed Reader page which uses an API from google to load RSS feeds.
In order to see the page open index.html on your favorite browser.
As you will notice, the page is rendered dynamically and the Javascript code to render the page is on the js/app.js file.

In addition to the RSS feeds, the page contains a testing suite. Scrow down to the end of the page to see the tests results.
The tests were created using a Jasmine suite. The code for the testing suite is found on the jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file.
